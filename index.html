			<p>Dale Chihuly, an American artist, has mastered the translucent and transparent qualities of ice, water, glass, and neon, to create works of art that transform the everyday experience. He is globally renowned for his ambitious site-specific installations in public spaces as well as exhibitions presented in museums and gardens worldwide.</p>
			
			<p>Born in 1941 in Tacoma, Washington, Chihuly was introduced to glass while studying interior design at the University of Washington. After graduating in 1965, Chihuly enrolled in the first glass program in the country, at the University of Wisconsin. He continued his studies at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where he later established the glass program and taught for more than a decade. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice. There he observed the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. Major exhibitions include Chihuly Over Venice (1996); Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem (2000); Garden Cycle (2001-present); Chihuly at The New York Botanical Garden (2006); de Young Museum in San Francisco (2008); the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (2011); Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond (2012); Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal, Canada (2013); and the Royal Ontario Museum, Ontario, Canada (2016). Chihuly Garden and Glass opened at Seattle Center in 2012. Chihulyâ€™s lifelong fascination with glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings.
